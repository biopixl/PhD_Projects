Warning messages:
1: `aes_()` was deprecated in ggplot2 3.0.0.
ℹ Please use tidy evaluation idioms with `aes()`
ℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the ggtree package.
  Please report the issue at <https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/ggtree/issues>. 
2: In fortify(data, ...) : Arguments in `...` must be used.
✖ Problematic arguments:
• as.Date = as.Date
• yscale_mapping = yscale_mapping
• hang = hang
• size = 2
• color = "black"
ℹ Did you misspell an argument name?
3: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.
ℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.
ℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the ggtree package.
  Please report the issue at <https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/ggtree/issues>. 
4: `aes_string()` was deprecated in ggplot2 3.0.0.
ℹ Please use tidy evaluation idioms with `aes()`.
ℹ See also `vignette("ggplot2-in-packages")` for more information.
ℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the ggtree package.
  Please report the issue at <https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/ggtree/issues>. 
5: The `size` argument of `element_line()` is deprecated as of ggplot2 3.4.0.
ℹ Please use the `linewidth` argument instead.

Key improvements:
  - Proper cladogram showing Dog+Dingo clade with Fox as outgroup
  - Log-scale timeline integrated below tree
  - Clear visualization of three major events:
    * Dog-Fox divergence (12 Mya)
    * Domestication/Dog-Dingo split (8 kya)
    * Modern breed formation (200 ya)
  - Color-coded species roles (Test, Control, Outgroup)
  - Publication-quality aesthetics
