=== Simple Phylogeny with Broken Axis Complete ===
Clean cladogram with:
  - All species extant (extend to present, 0 Mya)
  - Fox-Dog divergence at 12 Mya
  - Dog-Dingo split at 0.008 Mya (8,000 years ago)
  - Broken axis (1-0.05 Mya) to extend Dog-Dingo branch visibility
  - Horizontal branch lengths show divergence times
