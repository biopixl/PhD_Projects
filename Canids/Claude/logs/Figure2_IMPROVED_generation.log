=== Figure 2 Summary ===
Genes analyzed: 17,046
Significantly selected genes: 401 (2.35%)
Mean ω: 0.78
Median ω: 0.66
Range ω: 0.00 - 7.42
Strong selection (p < 1e-10): 254 genes (63.3%)

=== IMPROVEMENTS APPLIED ===
✓ Fixed p-value = 0 issue (replaced with minimum non-zero)
✓ Removed extreme omega outliers (> 10)
✓ Applied log scale to omega axis for better visualization
✓ Improved text positioning to prevent cropping/overlap
✓ Updated deprecated 'size' to 'linewidth' parameters
✓ Increased DPI to 600 (matching Figure 1)
✓ Optimized figure dimensions (12x10)
✓ Reduced to top 10 genes for clearer labeling
