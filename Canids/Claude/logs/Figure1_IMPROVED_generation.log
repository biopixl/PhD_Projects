Warning messages:
1: `aes_()` was deprecated in ggplot2 3.0.0.
ℹ Please use tidy evaluation idioms with `aes()`
ℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the ggtree package.
  Please report the issue at <https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/ggtree/issues>. 
2: In fortify(data, ...) : Arguments in `...` must be used.
✖ Problematic arguments:
• as.Date = as.Date
• yscale_mapping = yscale_mapping
• hang = hang
• size = 1.8
ℹ Did you misspell an argument name?
3: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.
ℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.
ℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the ggtree package.
  Please report the issue at <https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/ggtree/issues>. 
4: `aes_string()` was deprecated in ggplot2 3.0.0.
ℹ Please use tidy evaluation idioms with `aes()`.
ℹ See also `vignette("ggplot2-in-packages")` for more information.
ℹ The deprecated feature was likely used in the ggtree package.

Generated publication-quality figures:
  1. Figure1A_Phylogeny_Timeline.pdf/png
     - Combined phylogeny + timeline in cladogram format
     - Timeline axis spanning 12 Mya to present
     - Clear annotation of divergence events

  2. Figure1B_StudyDesign_Flowchart.pdf/png
     - Standalone conceptual study design
     - Professional arrow connections and spacing
     - Four-column layout with clear flow

Improvements over previous version:
  ✓ Phylogeny and timeline unified (addresses user feedback)
  ✓ Flowchart expanded to standalone figure (better spacing)
  ✓ Professional arrow connections (properly aligned)
  ✓ Colorblind-friendly palette (Okabe-Ito)
  ✓ 600 DPI publication quality

Ready for manuscript integration.
