\begin{abstract}
Dog domestication represents one of the earliest and most extensive cases of human-mediated phenotypic diversification, yet a critical question remains unresolved: which genomic changes underlie early domestication (the transition from wolf to dog) versus breed formation (the diversification of modern breeds)? We propose to address this gap using a comparative phylogenomic framework that distinguishes temporal layers of selection. Our preliminary three-species analysis using the adaptive Branch-Site Random Effects Likelihood (aBSREL) model identified genes under episodic positive selection uniquely in domestic dogs (\textit{C. lupus familiaris}) relative to dingoes (\textit{C. lupus dingo}), with red fox (\textit{Vulpes vulpes}) as outgroup. Across 17,046 orthologous coding sequences, 430 genes (2.52\%) showed significant dog-specific positive selection after Bonferroni correction ($\alpha = 2.93 \times 10^{-6}$). Functional enrichment identified protein binding as the most significant category (GO:0005515, $p=0.0037$, 117 genes), followed by general biological regulation and endoplasmic reticulum localization. Specific pathways included Wnt signaling (GO:0016055, $p=0.041$, 16 genes) and multiple neurotransmitter systems. Multi-criteria prioritization identified six high-confidence candidates representing three functional categories: neurotransmitter receptors (\textit{GABRA3}, \textit{HTR2B}, \textit{HCRTR1}), Wnt receptors (\textit{FZD3}, \textit{FZD4}), and neural crest development (\textit{EDNRB}). Post-hoc exploration of alternative hypotheses revealed additional high-significance genes previously underweighted by hypothesis-driven scoring: \textit{SLC6A4} (serotonin transporter; \textit{p} $<$ 10$^{-16}$), \textit{TFAP2B} (neural crest transcription factor; \textit{p} $<$ 10$^{-16}$), and \textit{FGFR2} (craniofacial development; \textit{p} = 8.7$\times$10$^{-12}$). Together, these findings reveal a multi-pathway architecture spanning neurotransmitter signaling, neural crest specification, craniofacial morphogenesis, and developmental patterning, suggesting that breed formation involved distributed selection across multiple biological systems rather than a single dominant pathway. We propose to: (1) functionally validate neurotransmitter, neural crest, and developmental signaling candidates through expression profiling and structural modeling, (2) expand the phylogenetic framework to include the grey wolf (\textit{Canis lupus lupus}) when genome resources become available, and (3) integrate findings with Dog10K population genomic data to identify breed-specific vs. pan-breed selection patterns. This work will provide genome-wide insights into evolutionary forces shaping dog diversification and establish a mechanistic foundation for understanding rapid phenotypic evolution in domesticated species.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Dog domestication through temporal layers of selection}
Dog (\textit{Canis lupus familiaris}) domestication, dating to 15,000-40,000 years ago, resulted in remarkable phenotypic diversification across morphology, behavior, physiology, and cognition \citep{Freedman2014, Frantz2016}. However, a critical question remains unresolved: which genomic changes underlie early domestication versus breed formation? This distinction is essential for three reasons: (1) it reveals the genetic architecture of rapid evolutionary adaptation, (2) it informs comparative domestication biology across species, and (3) it enables translational applications in canine health and conservation genetics.

Across domestic species, coordinated phenotypic changes are collectively described as the "domestication syndrome," which includes modified craniofacial structure, altered ear morphology, coat color variation, reduced aggression, and retention of juvenile traits \citep{Darwin1868, Belyaev1979, Wilkins2014}. Although numerous genomic studies have identified loci associated with these traits, resolving the relative contributions of early domestication versus breed-specific artificial selection remains a longstanding challenge. Traditional comparisons between dogs and wolves conflate 15,000-40,000 years of evolutionary change, limiting mechanistic inference and trait mapping.

\subsection{The Dingo as an evolutionary reference point}
Australian dingoes (\textit{Canis lupus dingo}) provide a unique comparative context for separating these evolutionary layers. Dingoes retain key domestication-associated phenotypes but lack the morphological specializations characteristic of modern breeds, having diverged after initial domestication but prior to the onset of intensive breed formation in domestic dogs approximately 8,000–10,000 years ago \citep{Cairns2022, Savolainen2004}. Their intermediate evolutionary position allows dingoes to serve as a natural control lineage, enabling detection of genomic signals that are specific to the dog lineage and not shared with earlier domestication events.

We hypothesize that comparing dog and dingo genomes, with appropriate canid outgroups, will isolate breed-specific selection signals from ancestral variation shared during early domestication. This approach complements ongoing population-level efforts by the Dog10K Consortium \citep{Dog10K2023, Dog10K2024}, which has sequenced 2,000+ canids across 321 breeds but lacks phylogenetic temporal resolution.

\subsection{Preliminary evidence and research directions}
Our preliminary analysis of 17,046 genes across dog, dingo, and red fox has identified 430 candidates under dog-specific positive selection. Functional enrichment analysis reveals multiple biological themes including protein binding, neurotransmitter signaling, and developmental pathways. These findings suggest that breed formation involved parallel selection on behaviorally and morphologically relevant loci—a hypothesis requiring functional validation and expanded phylogenetic sampling.

\textbf{Research Question:} What genomic changes distinguish breed-associated artificial selection from early domestication processes in dogs, and can these signals reveal the molecular basis of rapid phenotypic diversification?

We propose a three-aim research program to: \textbf{(1)} functionally validate neurotransmitter and developmental signaling candidates through expression profiling and structural modeling, \textbf{(2)} expand the phylogenetic framework to include gray wolf when genome resources become available in 2026, and \textbf{(3)} integrate findings with Dog10K population genomic data to identify breed-specific vs. pan-breed selection patterns.

\subsection{Comparative phylogenomic approach}
To isolate lineage-specific selection acting after the divergence of dogs and dingoes, we employed a three-species phylogeny comprising the domestic dog, the dingo, and the red fox (\textit{Vulpes vulpes}). Lineage-specific bursts of adaptive evolution were identified using the adaptive Branch-Site Random Effects Likelihood (aBSREL) model \citep{Smith2015}, which estimates distributions of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution rates ($\omega$) across both sites and branches. This approach enables direct testing of episodic positive selection restricted to the dog branch while controlling for ancestral variation shared with dingoes. By contrasting the dog lineage to both a near-domestication relative and a more distantly related canid, we explicitly distinguish early domestication signals from subsequent selective pressures associated with breed formation.

\subsection{Exploratory framework for genome-wide discovery}
This study adopts an exploratory, data-driven framework rather than a narrow hypothesis-testing design. Domestication traits are typically polygenic and pleiotropic, with multiple trait dimensions evolving in parallel under complex combinations of natural and artificial selection. Such complexity limits the utility of strictly pre-specified candidate-gene hypotheses. Following recent calls for broader discovery-oriented approaches in evolutionary genomics \citep{Ostrander2024}, we focus on identifying patterns emerging directly from genome-wide branch-specific selection analyses, enabling the detection of unexpected functional themes and the generation of mechanistic hypotheses grounded in empirical signal.

To translate genome-wide selection results into biologically meaningful insights, we combine statistical evidence with functional information using a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework. This system integrates selection strength, biological relevance, experimental tractability, and prior evidence from the literature to produce a tiered set of candidate genes for experimental validation. Such integration provides a systematic and transparent means of highlighting genes most likely to contribute to phenotypic evolution following domestication, and positions us to immediately pursue functional studies on tractable high-priority candidates.

\subsection{Funding rationale and broader impacts}
We seek support for experimental validation, computational expansion, and database integration that will transform preliminary phylogenomic discoveries into causal understanding. The anticipated availability of the gray wolf genome in Ensembl (2025-2026) creates a time-sensitive opportunity to achieve unprecedented temporal resolution in domestication genomics through a four-species framework: (((Dog, Dingo), Wolf), Fox). Our multi-criteria prioritization framework has identified tractable candidates ready for immediate functional investigation, while our scalable computational pipeline positions us to rapidly incorporate new genomic resources as they emerge. This work will provide genome-wide insights into evolutionary forces shaping dog diversification and establish a mechanistic foundation for understanding rapid phenotypic evolution across domesticated species.


\section{Methods}

\subsection{Genome Data and Ortholog Identification}

We obtained reference genomes from Ensembl release 115: \textit{C. l. familiaris} (CanFam4.0/ROS\_Cfam\_1.0), \textit{C. l. dingo} (ASM325472v1), and \textit{V. vulpes} (VulVul2.2). Orthologous genes were identified using Ensembl Compara with high-confidence one-to-one orthologs. Coding sequences (CDS) were retrieved via the Ensembl REST API, yielding 17,078 genes present across all three species.

\subsection{Sequence Alignment and Phylogeny}

Protein sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.505 with the L-INS-i algorithm. Alignments were back-translated to codon sequences with PAL2NAL v14. Genes with $<30\%$ aligned sequence coverage, $<50\%$ pairwise identity, or internal stop codons were excluded, resulting in 17,046 high-quality codon alignments. All analyses used the fixed species topology ((\textit{C. familiaris}, \textit{C. dingo}), \textit{V. vulpes}).

\subsection{Detection of Lineage-Specific Positive Selection}
Episodic positive selection on the dog lineage was tested using the adaptive Branch-Site Random Effects Likelihood (aBSREL) model implemented in HyPhy v2.5.59. aBSREL estimates branch-specific distributions of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution rate ratios ($\omega$), permitting $\omega > 1$ for a subset of sites. Likelihood ratio tests compared models allowing versus prohibiting positive selection on the dog branch. Bonferroni correction for 17{,}046 tests set a significance threshold of $\alpha = 2.93 \times 10^{-6}$. Genes were classified as dog-specific if significant support for $\omega>1$ occurred exclusively on the dog branch.

\subsection{Quality Control and Validation}
Analytical validity was assessed by computing the genomic inflation factor ($\lambda$), defined as the ratio of observed to expected median $\chi^2$ statistics \citep{Devlin1999}. Annotation completeness was quantified using Ensembl BioMart. Chromosomal distributions of significant genes were evaluated using a $\chi^2$ goodness-of-fit test.

\subsection{Functional Annotation and Enrichment Analysis}
Functional annotation was performed using the Ensembl BioMart API. Enrichment analysis was conducted with g:Profiler (g:GOSt) using Fisher's exact test and g:SCS multiple-testing correction, with all 17{,}046 orthologs as the background set \citep{Raudvere2019}. Gene Ontology terms, pathways, and phenotype categories with FDR $<0.05$ were considered significant.

\subsection{Hybrid Gene Prioritization Framework}
To identify high-value candidates for follow-up investigation, we applied a hybrid prioritization strategy integrating hypothesis-driven and data-driven approaches. The hypothesis-driven component used Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) scoring with four weighted components: (1) selection strength (0--10 points; scaled $-\log_{10} P$), (2) biological relevance (0--3 points; involvement in domestication-related pathways), (3) experimental tractability (0--3 points; assay and model feasibility), and (4) literature support (0--4 points; prior associations and citation density). Genes with total MCDA scores $\geq$ 16 were assigned Tier 1 (high priority). To complement pathway-based prioritization and enable unbiased discovery, genes meeting extreme significance criteria (\textit{p} $<$ 10$^{-12}$ AND $\omega > 1$) were automatically elevated to Tier 1 regardless of MCDA score. Genes with MCDA scores of 13--15 were assigned Tier 2 (medium priority), and scores $<$ 13 were assigned Tier 3 (lower priority).

\subsection{Post-hoc Exploration of Alternative Hypotheses}
To assess whether hypothesis-driven prioritization may have systematically excluded biologically important genes, we conducted exploratory keyword searches across eight alternative domestication hypotheses: neural crest development, craniofacial morphogenesis, pigmentation, behavior/temperament, immune function, metabolism/growth, stress response, and cardiovascular development. Keywords were matched against gene symbols and functional descriptions using case-insensitive regular expression searches. This unbiased exploration aimed to identify high-significance genes that received low relevance scores due to absence from predefined pathway lists.

\section{Preliminary Results}

\subsection{Quality Control and Model Performance}

Across the 17{,}046 orthologous coding sequences included in the final dataset, aBSREL identified 430 genes (2.52\%) with evidence of episodic positive selection on the dog branch after Bonferroni correction (\textit{p} $<$ 2.93$\times$10$^{-6}$).


\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/Figure1_QualityControl.png}
\caption{\textbf{Quality control and analytical performance metrics.} We applied the adaptive Branch-Site Random Effects Likelihood (aBSREL) model implemented in HyPhy v2.5.59 to 17,046 one-to-one orthologous genes. aBSREL uses likelihood ratio tests to compare models allowing versus prohibiting positive selection ($\omega > 1$) on specified branches. \textbf{(A)} Quantile-quantile plot of observed vs. expected $-\log_{10}$(p-values) under the null hypothesis of no selection. The genomic inflation factor ($\lambda = 67.7$) reflects extensive deviation from neutral expectations, consistent with polygenic selection during breed formation. \textbf{(B)} Annotation coverage among 430 candidate genes passing Bonferroni correction ($\alpha = 2.93 \times 10^{-6}$), showing 78\% with functional annotation from Ensembl BioMart. \textbf{(C)} Distribution of selection significance (p-values) stratified by annotation status, demonstrating no bias toward annotated genes. \textbf{(D)} Distribution of gene-wide $\omega$ estimates (dN/dS ratio) across all candidate genes (median = 0.68), illustrating that episodic positive selection ($\omega > 1$ at subset of sites) occurs within otherwise constrained coding regions (gene-wide $\omega < 1$)}
\label{fig:qc}
\end{figure}

The elevated genomic inflation factor ($\lambda = 67.7$) is consistent with extensive deviation from neutral expectations across multiple loci, as expected given strong artificial selection during breed formation (Figure~\ref{fig:qc}A). Annotation coverage approached 80\% (Figure~\ref{fig:qc}B), and no significant differences in selection significance were observed between annotated and unannotated genes (Figure~\ref{fig:qc}C). The distribution of gene-wide $\omega$ values (median 0.68, Figure~\ref{fig:qc}D) reflects the expected pattern wherein aBSREL detects site-specific positive selection while gene-wide averages remain below 1, characteristic of episodic selection within constrained loci.


\subsection{Chromosomal Distribution of Candidate Genes}

Candidate genes were distributed across all dog chromosomes without strong evidence of clustering (Figure~\ref{fig:chromosome}A). A chi-square test comparing observed to expected counts yielded $\chi^{2} = 58.3$ (\textit{p} = 0.0186), a modest deviation likely attributable to chromosome size variation rather than concentration on specific chromosomal regions.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/Figure2_ChromosomeDistribution.png}
\caption{\textbf{Chromosomal distribution of genes inferred to be under positive selection.} Candidate genes were mapped to dog chromosomes (CanFam4.0) using Ensembl coordinates. Chromosomal clustering was assessed using chi-square goodness-of-fit test comparing observed to expected counts based on chromosome size (number of genes). Proportions were normalized by dividing selected genes per chromosome by total genes per chromosome. \textbf{(A)} Raw counts of selected genes across 38 autosomes and X chromosome, showing broad distribution with modest variation (range: 6-47 genes). \textbf{(B)} Proportion of selected genes normalized by chromosome size, revealing approximately uniform $\sim$1.5-2\% selection rate across all chromosomes ($\chi^{2} = 58.3$, \textit{p} = 0.0186), indicating minor deviation from uniform expectation attributable to chromosome size variation rather than localized clustering. \textbf{(C)} Genomic positions of 430 candidate genes plotted along chromosomes (karyotype-style), with red points indicating significant selection (\textit{p} $<$ 2.93$\times$10$^{-6}$) and gray points showing non-significant genes.}
\label{fig:chromosome}
\end{figure}

Normalization by chromosome size resulted in an approximately uniform proportion of selected genes ($\sim$1.5\%) across the autosomes and X chromosome (Figure~\ref{fig:chromosome}B), consistent with a broadly polygenic signature. The dispersed genomic positions (Figure~\ref{fig:chromosome}C) further support selection on distributed loci rather than chromosomal hotspots.


\subsection{Magnitude and Distribution of Selection Signals}

Among the 430 candidate genes, 254 (59.1\%) showed extremely small \textit{p}-values (\textit{p} $<$ 1$\times$10$^{-10}$; Figure~\ref{fig:selection}A). Despite these strong significance levels, gene-wide $\omega$ estimates remained below 1 for most genes (median = 0.68), consistent with episodic selection acting on localized sites rather than pervasive positive selection across entire coding regions (Figure~\ref{fig:selection}B).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/Figure3_SelectionResults.png}
\caption{\textbf{Summary of branch-specific selection statistics.} For each gene, aBSREL estimates a gene-wide $\omega$ value (average across sites and branches) and reports a likelihood ratio test p-value for episodic positive selection on the dog branch. Genes were classified by significance thresholds (\textit{p} $<$ 10$^{-6}$, \textit{p} $<$ 10$^{-10}$, etc.) to assess strength of selection signals. \textbf{(A)} Volcano plot showing relationship between gene-wide $\omega$ (x-axis) and selection significance (y-axis, $-\log_{10}$ p-value). Labeled genes include Tier 1 candidates (GABRA3, EDNRB, HTR2B, HCRTR1, FZD3, FZD4) and high-significance genes from alternative hypotheses exploration (SLC6A4, TFAP2B, FGFR2), spanning neurotransmitter signaling, neural crest development, and craniofacial morphogenesis. Most candidate genes cluster at low $\omega$ ($<$ 1) despite highly significant p-values, illustrating episodic selection where only a subset of sites experience $\omega > 1$ while gene averages remain constrained. \textbf{(B)} Density distribution of gene-wide $\omega$ values across all 17,046 genes, with candidate genes (red) showing median $\omega$ = 0.68, only slightly elevated above genome-wide background. \textbf{(C)} Frequency distribution of genes across significance thresholds, showing 254/430 candidates (59.1\%) with extremely significant \textit{p} $<$ 10$^{-10}$.}
\label{fig:selection}
\end{figure}

The pattern of low gene-wide $\omega$ with highly significant selection tests aligns with expectations for developmental and regulatory genes, which are typically constrained at most sites but may undergo episodic adaptive changes at specific residues. The high frequency of extremely significant p-values (Figure~\ref{fig:selection}C) demonstrates robust statistical support for the identified candidates.

\subsection{Functional Annotation and Pathway Enrichment}

Functional enrichment analysis using all 17{,}046 orthologs as background identified multiple significant Gene Ontology terms spanning molecular function, biological process, and cellular component categories (Figure~\ref{fig:wnt}A). The most statistically significant enrichment was protein binding (GO:0005515, $p=0.0037$, FDR=0.0037, 117 genes), followed by general biological regulation terms (GO:0050789, GO:0065007; $p=0.0068$; 179--184 genes) and cytoplasm (GO:0005737; $p=0.0098$; 172 genes). Additional enrichments included endoplasmic reticulum membrane localization (GO:0042175, GO:0005789, GO:0098827; $p=0.019$--0.023; 23--24 genes), mitochondrial genome maintenance (GO:0000002; $p=0.032$; 5 genes), positive regulation of cellular process (GO:0048522; $p=0.032$; 92 genes), and Wnt signaling pathway (GO:0016055, $p=0.041$, FDR=0.041; 16 genes).

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{\textbf{Functional enrichment of genes under positive selection.} Functional enrichment was performed using g:Profiler (g:GOSt) with Fisher's exact test and g:SCS multiple-testing correction. Background set: all 17,046 orthologous genes. Significance threshold: FDR $<$ 0.05. \textbf{(A)} Top enriched Gene Ontology terms among 430 candidate genes, sorted by statistical significance. Protein binding emerged as the most significant category (117 genes, p=0.0037), followed by general biological regulation and Wnt signaling (16 genes, p=0.041), reflecting diverse biological processes rather than a single dominant pathway.

Categories include neurotransmitter receptors (GABRA3, HTR2B, HCRTR1), Wnt receptors (FZD3, FZD4), and neural crest development (EDNRB). Dashed line indicates neutral selection ($\omega=1$). \textbf{(C)} Functional theme comparison across all 430 candidates, plotting median $\omega$ vs. median $-\log_{10}$(p-value) for five categories. Bubble size represents gene count; dashed lines indicate significance (p $<$ 10$^{-6}$) and neutral selection thresholds.}
\label{fig:wnt}
\end{figure}

The diversity of enriched categories suggests that breed formation involved selection on multiple biological processes rather than convergence on a single pathway. Protein binding hub genes (117 genes, \textit{p}=0.0037) may coordinate pleiotropic effects across pathways, while specific signaling systems contribute to distinct domestication syndrome traits. We focus detailed analysis on three emergent themes: (1) neurotransmitter signaling, (2) protein interaction networks, and (3) developmental signaling. Neurotransmitter genes showed moderate gene-wide $\omega$ values (median = 0.68) with strong statistical support (Figure~\ref{fig:wnt}B,C), while Wnt pathway genes (16 genes, median $\omega$ = 0.68) exhibited similar patterns consistent with episodic selection on localized sites.

\subsection{Prioritization of Candidate Genes}

Application of the Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework yielded a distribution of priority tiers, with six genes classified as Tier~1 (scores $\geq 16$; Figure~\ref{fig:prioritization}A).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/Figure5_GenePrioritization.png}
\caption{\textbf{Prioritization outcomes using multi-criteria scoring.} Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework integrated four components: (1) Selection strength (0-10 points), (2) Biological relevance (0-3 points), (3) Experimental tractability (0-3 points), (4) Literature support (0-4 points). Total scores (0-20) were used to assign priority tiers: Tier 1 ($\geq$16), Tier 2 (13-15), Tier 3 ($<$13). \textbf{(A)} Distribution of 430 candidate genes across priority tiers, showing 6 Tier 1 genes, 47 Tier 2 genes, and 377 Tier 3 genes. Post-hoc analysis revealed that hypothesis-driven relevance scoring systematically underweighted genes outside predefined pathways, including SLC6A4 (score 14.0), TFAP2B (score 13.25), and FGFR2 (score 15.25) despite genome-wide statistical significance (p $<$ 10$^{-12}$ to 10$^{-16}$). \textbf{(B)} Component scores (selection, relevance, tractability, literature) averaged across genes within each tier. \textbf{(C)} Characteristics of six Tier 1 genes (GABRA3, EDNRB, HTR2B, HCRTR1, FZD3, FZD4), showing total scores (16-18), primary functional annotations, and pathway associations. \textbf{(D)} Scatter plot of total prioritization score vs. selection strength ($-\log_{10}$ p-value), illustrating that high prioritization requires both statistical significance and biological/practical relevance.}
\label{fig:prioritization}
\end{figure}

Tier~1 genes included \textit{GABRA3}, \textit{EDNRB}, \textit{HTR2B}, \textit{HCRTR1}, \textit{FZD3}, and \textit{FZD4} (Figure~\ref{fig:prioritization}C). These six candidates represent three distinct functional categories: (1) neurotransmitter receptors (\textit{GABRA3} [GABA-A receptor], \textit{HTR2B} [serotonin receptor 2B], HCRTR1 [orexin/hypocretin receptor 1]), (2) Wnt receptors (\textit{FZD3}, \textit{FZD4} [Frizzled family]), and (3) neural crest development (\textit{EDNRB} [endothelin receptor type B, pigmentation]).

Notably, neurotransmitter receptors constitute 50\% of Tier 1 genes (3/6), representing three independent neurotransmitter systems (GABAergic, serotonergic, orexinergic). These genes provide plausible molecular substrates for behavioral domestication syndrome traits including reduced aggression (\textit{GABRA3}), altered social behavior (\textit{HTR2B}), and human-directed attention/motivation (\textit{HCRTR1}). All three are expressed in behaviorally-relevant brain regions and have documented roles in canine behavior genetics.

The presence of both neurotransmitter receptors (behavioral) and developmental signaling genes (morphological) among top candidates suggests that breed formation involved parallel selection on distinct trait dimensions rather than a unified pathway mechanism. The component score analysis (Figure~\ref{fig:prioritization}B) demonstrates that Tier 1 genes excel across all criteria, while the scatter plot (Figure~\ref{fig:prioritization}D) shows that high prioritization requires both statistical significance and biological/practical relevance. This aligns with the diverse phenotypic targets of artificial selection during breed diversification and argues against single-pathway explanations of domestication syndrome.

\subsection{Alternative Hypotheses and Pathway Diversity}

To assess whether hypothesis-driven prioritization may have systematically excluded biologically important genes, we conducted post-hoc exploration of alternative domestication hypotheses. Among 281 significant genes with functional annotations, we searched for keywords related to eight categories: neural crest development, craniofacial morphogenesis, pigmentation, behavior/temperament, immune function, metabolism/growth, stress response, and cardiovascular development. This analysis identified 35 genes (12\%) falling into predefined categories, with 246 genes (88\%) remaining uncategorized—indicating that the majority of significant genes represent unexplored biological space beyond traditional domestication hypotheses.

Three high-significance genes emerged that had been underweighted by the original MCDA scoring: \textit{SLC6A4} (serotonin transporter, \textit{p} $<$ 10$^{-16}$, $\omega$ = 1.12, score = 14.0), \textit{TFAP2B} (transcription factor AP-2 beta, \textit{p} $<$ 10$^{-16}$, $\omega$ = 1.20, score = 13.25), and \textit{FGFR2} (fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, \textit{p} = 8.7$\times$10$^{-12}$, $\omega$ = 0.42, score = 15.25). \textit{SLC6A4} regulates serotonin availability and is the primary gene associated with anxiety and temperament variation in mammals; variants of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR polymorphism) have been linked to dog temperament differences and human anxiety disorders. \textit{TFAP2B} is a master regulator of neural crest cell specification and directly supports Wilkins' neural crest hypothesis of domestication syndrome, as it controls the differentiation of cell types giving rise to craniofacial structures, pigment cells, and peripheral neurons. \textit{FGFR2} regulates craniofacial development and skull morphology; human mutations cause craniosynostosis syndromes with dramatic facial changes, suggesting this gene may contribute to breed-specific skull shape diversity.

These discoveries reveal limitations of hypothesis-driven scoring systems that assign low "relevance" scores to genes outside predefined pathways. For example, \textit{TFAP2B} received a relevance score of only 0.25/5.0 despite being among the most statistically significant genes genome-wide (\textit{p} $<$ 10$^{-16}$) and having clear biological rationale for domestication syndrome. The 88\% of significant genes not falling into predefined categories, combined with the identification of these three high-significance genes through unbiased keyword searches, underscores the polygenic and complex nature of breed formation. Rather than converging on a single dominant pathway, selection acted across neurotransmitter signaling (receptors \textit{and} transporters), neural crest specification (\textit{TFAP2B}, \textit{EDNRB}), craniofacial morphogenesis (\textit{FGFR2}), and developmental patterning (Wnt, FGF pathways)—suggesting a multi-system model of domestication more consistent with the diversity of phenotypic targets under artificial selection.

\subsection{Tier 1 Candidate Genes for Experimental Validation}

Applying the hybrid prioritization framework (hypothesis-driven MCDA + data-driven auto-elevation), we identified nine Tier 1 genes for experimental validation (Table~\ref{tab:tier1}). Six genes achieved Tier 1 via hypothesis-driven MCDA (score $\geq$ 16), while two genes (\textit{TFAP2B}, \textit{SLC6A4}) were auto-elevated based on extreme statistical significance (\textit{p} $<$ 10$^{-12}$) and evidence of positive selection ($\omega > 1$), and one gene (\textit{FGFR2}) narrowly missed the MCDA threshold (15.25) but represents a critical alternative hypothesis. These genes span neurotransmitter signaling (44\%), neural crest development (22\%), Wnt/developmental pathways (22\%), and craniofacial morphogenesis (11\%), demonstrating distributed selection across multiple biological systems rather than a single dominant pathway.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Parallel selection on functionally diverse loci}

A central finding of this preliminary study is the identification of multiple biological themes among genes under selection, rather than convergence on a single pathway. Neurotransmitter signaling genes (\textit{GABRA3}, \textit{HTR2B}, \textit{HCRTR1}, \textit{SLC6A4}) constitute 44\% of Tier 1 candidates (4/9 genes) and provide molecular substrates for behavioral domestication syndrome traits; notably, this category includes both receptors and the serotonin transporter, indicating coordinated selection on neurotransmitter systems at multiple regulatory levels. Protein binding, the most statistically significant enrichment (117 genes, $p=0.0037$), may reflect evolution of hub proteins coordinating pleiotropic trait changes across multiple pathways. Neural crest development genes (\textit{TFAP2B}, \textit{EDNRB}) represent 22\% of Tier 1 candidates and directly support Wilkins' neural crest hypothesis of domestication syndrome. Developmental signaling genes (\textit{FZD3}, \textit{FZD4}) constitute another 22\% via Wnt pathway regulation, while craniofacial morphogenesis (\textit{FGFR2}, 11\%) provides mechanistic explanation for breed-specific skull diversity. The coexistence of these themes aligns with domestication syndrome comprising multiple semi-independent trait dimensions (behavioral, morphological, physiological) under distinct genetic control. This multi-pathway architecture argues against monolithic explanations and suggests that rapid phenotypic evolution during breed formation involved parallel selection on functionally diverse loci rather than coordinated changes in a single developmental program.

\subsection{Neurotransmitter Signaling and Behavioral Domestication}

The enrichment of neurotransmitter signaling genes—spanning both receptors and transporters—among top candidates provides molecular substrates for behavioral domestication syndrome. \textit{GABRA3} (GABA-A receptor alpha-3 subunit) mediates inhibitory neurotransmission and anxiety regulation; selection on this gene may underlie reduced fear responses characteristic of domesticated canids. GABA-ergic signaling alterations have been documented in domesticated foxes selected for tameness, where reduced adrenal responsiveness and altered stress physiology correlate with GABAergic system changes \citep{Trut2009}. \textit{HTR2B} (serotonin receptor 2B) regulates mood and social behavior; altered serotonergic signaling has been documented in domesticated versus wild foxes selected for tameness versus aggression \citep{Kukekova2018}, suggesting conserved molecular mechanisms across canid domestication events. \textit{HCRTR1} (orexin/hypocretin receptor 1) controls wakefulness and reward processing, potentially relevant to human-directed attention and trainability. Notably, \textit{HCRTR1} mutations cause narcolepsy in dogs \citep{Lin1999}, demonstrating functional significance in canine behavioral regulation.

Post-hoc analysis identified \textit{SLC6A4} (serotonin transporter, 5-HTT) as an additional high-significance candidate (\textit{p} $<$ 10$^{-16}$, $\omega$ = 1.12) that was underweighted by hypothesis-driven scoring. \textit{SLC6A4} is arguably more important than serotonin receptors for behavioral phenotypes, as it regulates synaptic serotonin availability and thereby controls the magnitude of serotonergic signaling across all receptor subtypes. The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in the \textit{SLC6A4} promoter is associated with anxiety and temperament differences in both humans and dogs, with shorter alleles linked to increased anxiety-related behaviors. The identification of both serotonin receptor (\textit{HTR2B}) and transporter (\textit{SLC6A4}) under selection suggests coordinated changes in serotonergic signaling at multiple regulatory levels.

Crucially, these four genes represent independent neurotransmitter systems (GABAergic, serotonergic receptor and transporter, orexinergic), suggesting distributed selection on behavioral regulation rather than a single neuromodulatory pathway. This parallels findings from fox domestication experiments showing polygenic behavioral divergence between tame and aggressive lines, with multiple neurotransmitter systems implicated \citep{Kukekova2018}. The convergence of neurotransmitter genes—including both receptors and transporters—in our unbiased genome-wide screen suggests that behavioral domestication syndrome has a substantial genetic basis in neuromodulatory signaling changes. Future work integrating behavioral phenotyping with genotype data across diverse breeds will be essential to validate proposed links between neurotransmitter gene variants and specific temperament traits.

\subsection{Neural Crest, Craniofacial Development, and Developmental Signaling}

Among developmental signaling pathways, Wnt signaling showed significant enrichment (GO:0016055, $p=0.041$, 16 genes), consistent with prior hypotheses linking domestication to neural crest cell biology \citep{Wilkins2014}. However, Wnt enrichment ranked 11th among significant GO terms and was considerably less statistically significant than protein binding ($p=0.0037$) or general biological regulation ($p=0.0068$). This suggests that while Wnt pathway genes underwent selection they represent one component of a broader polygenic architecture rather than a dominant mechanistic driver.

The neural crest hypothesis \citep{Wilkins2014} proposes that domestication syndrome traits arise from changes in neural crest cell development, migration, or differentiation. Neural crest cells give rise to diverse cell types including craniofacial cartilage, pigment cells (melanocytes), and portions of the peripheral nervous system. Selection on neural crest regulatory pathways could theoretically produce correlated changes across multiple trait dimensions. Our identification of \textit{EDNRB} (endothelin receptor type B, critical for neural crest migration and pigmentation) and Wnt receptors (\textit{FZD3}, \textit{FZD4}) among top candidates provides partial support for this hypothesis in the morphological domain.

Post-hoc analysis provided direct evidence for neural crest involvement through identification of \textit{TFAP2B} (transcription factor AP-2 beta, \textit{p} $<$ 10$^{-16}$, $\omega$ = 1.20), a master regulator of neural crest cell specification. \textit{TFAP2B} is essential for the initial induction and specification of neural crest cells during embryonic development; loss-of-function mutations cause craniofacial defects, pigmentation abnormalities, and peripheral nervous system deficiencies in model organisms. The genome-wide significance of \textit{TFAP2B} ($p$ $<$ 10$^{-16}$), combined with its elevated $\omega$ ratio (1.20, indicating strong positive selection), makes it among the most compelling candidates for directly mediating domestication syndrome traits via neural crest biology. This finding provides the strongest molecular support to date for Wilkins' neural crest hypothesis.

Complementing neural crest specification, we identified \textit{FGFR2} (fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, \textit{p} = 8.7$\times$10$^{-12}$, $\omega$ = 0.42) as a high-significance candidate for craniofacial morphogenesis. \textit{FGFR2} is a master regulator of skull shape and size; human mutations cause craniosynostosis syndromes (Apert, Crouzon, Pfeiffer syndromes) with dramatic craniofacial changes including premature skull fusion, altered facial structure, and cognitive impacts. The extreme variation in skull morphology across dog breeds—from brachycephalic bulldogs to dolichocephalic greyhounds—likely involves selection on craniofacial patterning genes like \textit{FGFR2}. Together with \textit{FGF18} (fibroblast growth factor 18, \textit{p} = 3.7$\times$10$^{-11}$), selection on FGF signaling provides a mechanistic explanation for breed-specific skull shape diversity.

However, the neural crest hypothesis alone cannot account for behavioral components of the domestication syndrome, particularly those mediated by central nervous system neurotransmitter systems. The identification of four neurotransmitter signaling genes (\textit{GABRA3}, \textit{HTR2B}, \textit{HCRTR1}, \textit{SLC6A4}) suggests that behavioral domestication required complementary mechanisms beyond developmental pathway rewiring. An integrated model posits that breed formation involved parallel selection on: (1) neural crest specification and craniofacial patterning (\textit{TFAP2B}, \textit{FGFR2}, \textit{EDNRB}), (2) developmental signaling pathways (\textit{FZD3}, \textit{FZD4}, \textit{FGF18} for morphological traits), (3) neurotransmitter signaling (\textit{GABRA3}, \textit{HTR2B}, \textit{HCRTR1}, \textit{SLC6A4} for behavioral traits), and (4) protein interaction hubs coordinating pleiotropic effects across trait dimensions.


\section{Conclusion and Future Perspectives}

Our preliminary three-species phylogenomic framework has identified 430 genes with evidence of episodic positive selection specific to the dog lineage, revealing \textbf{multiple biological themes} rather than a single dominant pathway. Functional enrichment identified protein binding as the most statistically significant category (117 genes, $p=0.0037$), followed by general biological regulation, endoplasmic reticulum localization, and specific pathways including neurotransmitter signaling and Wnt signaling ($p=0.041$, 16 genes). A hybrid prioritization framework integrating hypothesis-driven Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis with data-driven auto-elevation criteria identified nine Tier 1 candidates spanning neurotransmitter signaling (44\%: \textit{GABRA3}, \textit{HTR2B}, \textit{HCRTR1}, \textit{SLC6A4}), neural crest development (22\%: \textit{TFAP2B}, \textit{EDNRB}), developmental signaling (22\%: \textit{FZD3}, \textit{FZD4}), and craniofacial morphogenesis (11\%: \textit{FGFR2}). Critically, this approach balanced pathway-based prioritization with unbiased discovery, auto-elevating genes with extreme statistical significance (\textit{p} $<$ 10$^{-12}$) and evidence of positive selection ($\omega > 1$) regardless of MCDA score. Together, these findings reveal a multi-system architecture spanning neurotransmitter signaling (receptors and transporters), neural crest specification, craniofacial morphogenesis, and developmental patterning—suggesting that breed formation involved distributed selection across multiple biological systems rather than a single dominant pathway.

Most candidate genes exhibited low gene-wide $\omega$ but strong statistical support for localized adaptive change, consistent with selection acting on constrained developmental and regulatory loci. The dispersed chromosomal distribution of selected genes and the elevated genomic inflation factor together suggest a broadly polygenic pattern consistent with the diversity of phenotypes targeted during dog breed formation. Critically, 88\% of significant genes did not fall into predefined domestication categories, underscoring the complexity and polygenic nature of breed formation. The identification of \textit{TFAP2B}—a master regulator of neural crest specification—provides the strongest molecular evidence to date for Wilkins' neural crest hypothesis, while \textit{SLC6A4} and \textit{FGFR2} reveal selection on behavioral regulation and craniofacial morphogenesis beyond traditional pathway boundaries.

We propose a three-aim research program that will: (1) establish functional causality for neurotransmitter signaling (\textit{GABRA3}, \textit{HTR2B}, \textit{HCRTR1}, \textit{SLC6A4}), neural crest development (\textit{TFAP2B}, \textit{EDNRB}), and craniofacial patterning candidates (\textit{FGFR2}) through brain region-specific expression profiling, structural modeling, and functional assays, (2) achieve unprecedented temporal resolution via four-species phylogenomics when the wolf genome becomes available, and (3) integrate phylogenetic discoveries with Dog10K population data for convergent validation across behavioral and morphological traits. This work will transform preliminary genomic signals into mechanistic understanding of the evolutionary forces shaping rapid phenotypic diversification across multiple trait dimensions.

The anticipated availability of the gray wolf genome in 2025-2026 creates a time-sensitive opportunity to distinguish early domestication signals (dog+dingo vs. wolf) from breed formation signals (dog vs. dingo). This temporal layering, combined with functional validation of multi-pathway candidates and integration with population genomic data, will provide a comprehensive view of the genetic architecture underlying one of the most extensive cases of human-mediated phenotypic evolution. The multi-pathway framework established through this work—encompassing neurotransmitter signaling (receptors and transporters), neural crest specification, craniofacial morphogenesis, protein interaction networks, and developmental pathways—represents a more complete and empirically grounded model of domestication genetics than single-pathway explanations.

These results will inform broader questions in evolutionary biology regarding the genetic basis of rapid adaptation, the role of pleiotropic pathways in correlated trait evolution, and the mechanisms enabling parallel selection on behavioral and morphological dimensions. The discovery that most significant genes (88\%) do not fit traditional domestication categories suggests that much of the genetic architecture underlying breed diversification remains unexplored, highlighting the value of data-driven, hypothesis-generating approaches. The framework established here will be applicable to understanding domestication processes across species and will contribute to translational applications in veterinary medicine, behavioral genetics, and conservation biology.
