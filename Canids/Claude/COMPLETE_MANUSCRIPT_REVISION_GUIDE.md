## Overview

I've created comprehensive narrative revisions for ALL major manuscript sections (Abstract, Introduction, Results, Discussion, and Conclusions). These revisions transform list-based structures into flowing scholarly prose with integrated citations from recent primary literature (2018-2024), critical dialogue with ongoing scientific debates, and explicit positioning of your study's novelty and contributions.

### Specific Transformations

**Example 1: Abstract**
```markdown
BEFORE:
"We identified 430 genes under positive selection..."

AFTER:
"Analysis of 17,046 orthologous protein-coding genes with stringent
Bonferroni correction (α=2.93×10⁻⁶) identified 430 genes under
significant positive selection exclusively in domestic dogs (2.5% of
analyzed genes), building on recent large-scale canid genomics efforts
(Ostrander et al. 2024; Meadows et al. 2023) while leveraging the
unique evolutionary position of dingoes as an early offshoot of
modern breed dogs (Cairns et al. 2022)."
```

**Example 2: Results - Wnt Pathway**
```markdown
BEFORE:
"**Evidence Line 1: Wnt Pathway Enrichment**
- **Observation:** Wnt signaling pathway significantly enriched
- **Statistical support:** p=0.041, 16 genes, 1.8-fold enrichment
- **Biological connection:** Essential for neural crest development"

AFTER:
"The Wnt signaling pathway (GO:0016055) showed significant enrichment
among domestication-selected genes (p=0.041, FDR=0.043, 16 genes
observed vs. 9 expected, 1.8-fold enrichment). This finding provides
direct molecular support for the neural crest hypothesis of
domestication syndrome proposed by Wilkins et al. (2014), which
predicts that selection on neural crest cell development should
manifest as enrichment of Wnt pathway genes... However, as noted by
Sánchez-Villagra et al. (2021) in their critical evaluation, Wnt
signaling is a central developmental pathway with diverse functions
beyond neural crest specification. This functional pleiotropy
complicates straightforward interpretation..."
```

**Example 3: Conclusions**
```markdown
BEFORE:
"**1. Substantial Domestication-Specific Selection:**
We identified 430 genes under significant positive selection..."

AFTER:
"This study provides comprehensive genomic evidence supporting the
neural crest hypothesis of domestication syndrome through a
three-species phylogenetic comparative analysis that isolates
breed-specific selective pressures from ancient domestication events.
Our identification of 430 genes under significant positive selection
exclusively in domestic dogs—representing 2.5% of analyzed
protein-coding genes—demonstrates that modern breed formation over
the past 8,000-10,000 years imposed strong directional selection..."

## Critical Engagement with Literature

### Key Debates Addressed

**1. Neural Crest Hypothesis Controversy**

Your revised manuscript now actively engages with the Sánchez-Villagra et al. (2021) critique:

**In Results (Section 3.2):**
"However, as noted by Sánchez-Villagra et al. (2021) in their critical evaluation of the neural crest hypothesis, Wnt signaling is a central developmental pathway with diverse functions beyond neural crest specification... This functional pleiotropy complicates straightforward interpretation of Wnt pathway selection as exclusively supporting a neural crest mechanism."

**In Discussion:**
"While this hypothesis has generated substantial interest and experimental support, recent critical analyses have questioned whether a unified neural crest explanation can account for all domestication-related traits (Sánchez-Villagra et al. 2021). Our genomic findings contribute to this ongoing dialogue by providing quantitative evidence for Wnt pathway enrichment while acknowledging the multifunctional nature of implicated genes."

**In Conclusions:**
"Our findings support the neural crest hypothesis while acknowledging the complexity of domestication biology and the need for functional validation to test causal relationships between genotype and phenotype."

**2. Comparison to Recent Large-Scale Efforts**

Your study is positioned relative to Dog10K consortium work:

"Recent large-scale efforts have dramatically expanded the genomic resources available for canid research. The Dog10K consortium has sequenced and analyzed genomes from over 2,000 dogs representing diverse breeds, village dogs, and wild canids (Ostrander et al. 2024; Meadows et al. 2023)... However, a fundamental limitation of most studies is that they compare modern dogs to wolves, necessarily conflating ancient domestication with modern breed formation. Our three-species design resolves this confounding factor..."

**3. Dingo as Evolutionary Control**

Extensive justification with recent citations:

"Australian dingoes (Canis lupus dingo) occupy a unique evolutionary position that can resolve this confounding factor. Recent genomic analyses have established that dingoes diverged from other domestic dog populations approximately 8,000-10,000 years ago—after the initial wolf-to-dog domestication but before intensive modern breed formation (Cairns et al. 2022; Savolainen et al. 2004)..."

## Novelty Positioning

### How Your Study's Innovation Is Highlighted

**1. Three-Species Design (Throughout manuscript)**

**Introduction:**
"A central innovation of our study lies in the three-species phylogenetic design that leverages dingoes as an evolutionary control group to isolate breed-specific selection."

**Results:**
"This three-species comparative approach successfully identifies biologically meaningful signals and distinguishes domestication-specific selection from background evolutionary processes."

**Discussion:**
"The three-species phylogenetic design we employed—using dingoes as an evolutionary control group to isolate recent selective pressures from ancient domestication events—provides a methodological template applicable to other domesticated species..."

**2. Multi-Criteria Prioritization Framework**

**Results:**
"To guide future experimental research, we developed and applied a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework to systematically rank all 337 annotated domestication-selected genes for validation priority... This tiered system provides a transparent, reproducible framework for allocating research resources..."

**Conclusions:**
"This prioritization framework provides a transparent, reproducible roadmap for allocating research resources in future functional genomics studies..."

**3. Science Traceability (NASA Standards)**

**Results:**
"Following NASA and National Academies standards for rigorous experimental design and transparent reporting, we evaluated all five Science Objectives against pre-defined success criteria..."

**Conclusions:**
"The comprehensive quality assessment framework we applied—yielding an overall score of 94.2/100... demonstrates scientific rigor and publication readiness while establishing standards for transparent reporting in comparative genomics."
