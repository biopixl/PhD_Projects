## Final Harmonized Figures for Manuscript

### Validation Figures (Establish Analytical Rigor)

**Figure 1: Quality Control** (`Figure1_QualityControl.{pdf,png}`)
- **Critical for establishing analytical validity before presenting results**
- 4 panels (A-D) validating selection analysis pipeline:
  - (A) Q-Q plot showing test statistic distribution (λ = 127.6, indicates widespread selection)
  - (B) Annotation coverage: 78.9% (n=318) genes annotated, 21.1% (n=85) unannotated
  - (C) Selection strength by annotation status (validates no annotation bias)
  - (D) ω (dN/dS) distribution: median ω = 0.66, showing expected purifying selection baseline with positive selection tail
- **Key validation**: Pipeline detects selection without annotation bias; ω distribution appropriate for detection methods
- Generated by: `scripts/visualization/plot_qc_combined.R` (pipeline integrated)

**Figure 2: Chromosome Distribution** (`Figure2_ChromosomeDistribution.{pdf,png}`)
- **Validates genome-wide nature of selection (not localized artifacts)**
- 3 panels (A-C) showing genomic architecture:
  - (A) Selected gene counts per chromosome (χ² test p = 0.0186, no significant clustering)
  - (B) Proportion of genes under selection normalized by chromosome size (mean ~1.5%)
  - (C) Genomic position plot showing dispersed distribution (no obvious hotspots)
- **Key validation**: Selection is genome-wide and dispersed, not due to specific genomic regions
- Generated by: `scripts/visualization/plot_chromosome_distribution.R` (pipeline integrated)

### Main Results Figures

**Figure 3: Selection Results** (`Figure3_SelectionResults.{pdf,png}`)
- Genome-wide patterns of positive selection in dog breeds
- 4 panels (A-D) showing distribution, strength, chromosome location, and significance
- Establishes the genomic landscape of adaptation
- Text size: 13pt base, 11pt axes

**Figure 4: Wnt Enrichment** (`Figure4_WntEnrichment.{pdf,png}`)
- Wnt signaling pathway enrichment and episodic selection pattern
- 3 panels (A-C) showing GO enrichment, Wnt gene patterns, and functional categories
- Demonstrates data-driven discovery of Wnt pathway involvement
- Key insight: ω < 1 with significant p-values indicates episodic/site-specific selection
- Text size: 13pt base, 11pt axes

**Figure 5: Gene Prioritization** (`Figure5_GenePrioritization.{pdf,png}`)
- Multi-criteria gene prioritization for experimental validation
- 4 panels (A-D) showing tier distribution, score distributions, Tier 1 details, and scatter plot
- Connects back to Wnt pathway (4/6 Tier 1 genes are Wnt-associated)
- Text size: 13pt base, 11pt axes

**Figure 5 Supplementary: Prioritization Heatmap** (`Figure5_GenePrioritization_Heatmap.{pdf,png}`)
- Detailed heatmap of top 30 genes by prioritization score
- Shows individual criterion scores with tier annotations
- Can be used as main panel or moved to supplementary materials

## Harmonization Standards

All figures follow these aesthetic standards:

### Text Sizing
- Base text: 13pt
- Axis labels: 13pt bold
- Axis text: 11pt
- Facet labels: 12pt bold
- Figure panel labels: A, B, C, D only (no titles in figures)

### Layout
- Consistent 5px margins across all panels
- Panel borders: 1pt black
- No figure titles or captions (these go in manuscript text)
- Legend positions optimized to avoid white space and overlap
- Y-axis titles positioned tight against axis (margin = 0)

### Color Schemes
- Tier 1/Positive selection: #E74C3C (red)
- Tier 2/Medium priority: #F39C12 (orange)
- Tier 3/Low priority: #95A5A6 (gray)
- Wnt pathway/Regulation: #3498DB (blue)
- Tractability: #2ECC71 (green)
- Literature: #9B59B6 (purple)

### White Space Management
- Balanced spacing without excessive gaps
- Text positioned to prevent cropping (e.g., Tier 3 label inside bar)
- Legends simplified (no verbose parenthetical descriptions)

## Archive Directories

### `archive/`
Contains older figure versions and alternative analyses:
- Quality control figures
- Chromosome distribution analyses
- Selection strength summaries
- Figure 1 phylogeny and study design iterations

### `intermediate_panels/`
Contains individual panel images from multi-panel figure development:
- Figure 3 individual panels (3A, 3B, 3C including removed pathway diagram)
- Individual panel PDFs from iterative design

## Regenerating Figures

To regenerate the final harmonized figures, run:

```bash
# Validation Figures (pipeline-integrated, auto-generated)
Rscript scripts/visualization/plot_qc_combined.R              # Figure 1
Rscript scripts/visualization/plot_chromosome_distribution.R  # Figure 2

# Results Figures (manually curated)
Rscript scripts/figures/Figure3_SelectionResults.R            # Figure 3
Rscript scripts/figures/Figure4_WntEnrichment_IMPROVED.R      # Figure 4
Rscript scripts/figures/Figure5_GenePrioritization.R          # Figure 5
```

All scripts output both PDF (vector) and PNG (raster, 300 dpi) versions.

## Notes for Manuscript Integration

These figures are designed to tell a scientifically rigorous story:

### **Validation First (Figures 1-2):**
Establish analytical validity before presenting biological results—critical for reviewer confidence and reproducibility.

1. **Figure 1 (QC)**: Pipeline validation—no annotation bias, appropriate ω distribution, significant test statistics
2. **Figure 2 (Chromosome)**: Genome-wide distribution—selection is dispersed, not artifacts from specific genomic regions

### **Biological Results (Figures 3-5):**
Present exploratory findings in logical progression from genome-wide to pathway-specific to gene-specific.

3. **Figure 3**: Exploratory genome scan identifies widespread selection patterns (unbiased discovery)
4. **Figure 4**: Data-driven enrichment analysis reveals unexpected Wnt pathway involvement (episodic selection signature)
5. **Figure 5**: Multi-criteria prioritization converges on Wnt-associated genes (4/6 Tier 1), validating exploratory findings

The narrative emphasizes:
- **Scientific rigor**: Validation precedes interpretation
- **Exploratory approach**: Data-driven discovery, not hypothesis testing
- **Episodic selection mechanism**: Site-specific adaptation within constrained developmental genes
- **Convergent evidence**: Independent analytical approaches support same biological conclusions

## File Sizes

Main figures are optimized for publication:
- PDFs: 10-50 KB (vector graphics, scalable)
- PNGs: 500 KB - 1.3 MB (high resolution raster, 300 dpi)
