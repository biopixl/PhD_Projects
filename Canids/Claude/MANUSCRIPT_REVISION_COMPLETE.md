## Critical Engagement Examples

### 1. Sánchez-Villagra (2021) Critique Addressed

**Throughout Results and Discussion:**
"However, as noted by Sánchez-Villagra et al. (2021) in their critical evaluation of the neural crest hypothesis, Wnt signaling is a central developmental pathway with diverse functions beyond neural crest specification... This functional pleiotropy complicates straightforward interpretation of Wnt pathway selection as exclusively supporting a neural crest mechanism."

**In Conclusions:**
"Our findings support the neural crest hypothesis while acknowledging the complexity of domestication biology and the need for functional validation to test causal relationships between genotype and phenotype."

### 2. Positioning Relative to Dog10K Consortium

**In Introduction:**
"Recent large-scale efforts have dramatically expanded genomic resources. The Dog10K consortium has analyzed genomes from over 2,000 dogs (Ostrander et al. 2024; Meadows et al. 2023)... However, a fundamental limitation is that they compare modern dogs to wolves, conflating ancient domestication with modern breed formation. Our three-species design resolves this confounding factor..."

### 3. Dingo as Evolutionary Control Justified

**In Introduction (extensively):**
"Australian dingoes occupy a unique evolutionary position. Recent genomic analyses established that dingoes diverged approximately 8,000-10,000 years ago—after wolf-to-dog domestication but before intensive breed formation (Cairns et al. 2022; Savolainen et al. 2004)... This makes dingoes an ideal control lineage."

## Novelty Explicitly Positioned

### Three-Species Design Innovation

**Highlighted in:**
- Abstract: "building on recent large-scale canid genomics efforts while leveraging the unique evolutionary position of dingoes"
- Introduction: "A central innovation of our study lies in the three-species phylogenetic design"
- Results: "successfully identifies biologically meaningful signals"
- Discussion: "provides a methodological template applicable to other domesticated species"
- Conclusions: "isolates breed-specific selective pressures from ancient domestication events"

### Multi-Criteria Prioritization Framework

**Results:**
"To guide future experimental research, we developed and applied a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework... This tiered system provides a transparent, reproducible framework for allocating research resources..."

### NASA-Standard Traceability

**Results & Conclusions:**
"Following NASA and National Academies standards... demonstrates scientific rigor and publication readiness while establishing standards for transparent reporting in comparative genomics."

- Conclusions (lines 1624-1656) → New Conclusions

### Step 3: Format Citations for Target Journal (1-2 hours)
Choose your target journal:
