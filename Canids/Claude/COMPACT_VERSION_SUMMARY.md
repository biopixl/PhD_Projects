---

### Results
**Status**: UNCHANGED
**Lines**: Same content preserved
All 5 figures, statistics, and interpretations retained

---

### Discussion
**Original**: 19 lines (3 subsections)
**Compact**: 10 lines (2 paragraphs, no subsections)
**Reduction**: ~47% reduction

**Changes made**:
1. **Paragraph 1** - Merged "Parallel selection" + "Neurotransmitter Signaling" subsections
   - Focus on neurotransmitter receptors as central novel finding
   - Detailed coverage of GABRA3, HTR2B, HCRTR1 with functional roles
   - Citations preserved: Trut2009, Kukekova2018, Lin1999
   - Removed: Redundant statements about "50% of Tier 1", detailed fox experiment descriptions

2. **Paragraph 2** - Merged "Protein binding" + "Wnt Pathway" + "Integrated model"
   - Protein binding as hub coordinators
   - Wnt pathway relative importance (11th rank, not dominant)
   - Neural crest hypothesis support (EDNRB, FZD3, FZD4)
   - Multi-pathway architecture conclusion
   - Citation preserved: Wilkins2014

**Removed elements**:
- Subsection headings (streamlined flow)
- Repetitive statements about "multiple themes" and "not single pathway"
- Extended justification of why neurotransmitter finding is important
- Detailed neural crest cell biology explanation
- Lengthy discussion of why neural crest alone is insufficient
- Redundant listing of integrated model components

**Preserved elements**:
- All key scientific findings (neurotransmitter receptors, protein binding, Wnt pathway)
- All 4 citations (Trut2009, Kukekova2018, Lin1999, Wilkins2014)
- Functional roles of all Tier 1 genes
- Comparative context (fox domestication experiments)
- Multi-pathway framework conclusion
- Criticism of single-pathway explanations

## Condensation Strategy

### What was removed:
1. **Redundant explanations** - Concepts repeated across sections
2. **Verbose justifications** - Multi-sentence explanations of "why this matters"
3. **Excessive detail** - Extended background on well-known concepts
4. **Structural redundancy** - Subsection titles that added length without content
5. **Repetitive conclusions** - Statements about "multiple pathways" vs "single pathway" repeated multiple times

### What was preserved:
1. **All citations** - Every literature source retained with context
2. **All key findings** - 430 genes, neurotransmitter receptors, Wnt pathway, protein binding
3. **All statistics** - p-values, gene counts, percentages, enrichment results
4. **All functional details** - Gene roles, pathways, biological relevance
5. **Scientific narrative** - Problem → approach → findings → implications → future work

---

## Expected Page Count

**Original manuscript**: ~12-13 pages (estimated from 191 lines)
**Compact manuscript**: ~9-10 pages (estimated from 157 lines)

The compact version achieves the target 10-page length while maintaining scientific rigor, complete citation support, and narrative coherence.
