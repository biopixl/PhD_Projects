## Abstract

Wildland-urban interface (WUI) fires generate ash with complex geochemical signatures reflecting the heterogeneous materials combusted. We present a multi-modal assessment of metal contamination in ash from the January 2025 Eaton Fire (Los Angeles County, California), integrating inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), field reflectance spectroscopy (ASD), attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), and AVIRIS-3 airborne imaging spectroscopy. Analysis of 39 ash samples revealed universal exceedance of EPA Regional Screening Levels for arsenic (100% of samples) and chromium (100%), with 15.4% exceeding lead thresholds. Spatial autocorrelation analysis identified significant clustering for Pb (Moran's I = 0.454, p < 0.001) and Zn (I = 0.667, p < 0.001), with Getis-Ord Gi* hotspot analysis localizing seven statistically significant Pb hotspots. Partial least squares regression models demonstrated moderate spectral predictability for calcium (R²cv = 0.365) but limited capacity for toxic metals given available sample sizes. Multiple regression revealed strong mineral phase associations, with Zn correlated with silicates (R²adj = 0.838), Cr with carbonates (R²adj = 0.782), and Pb with Fe-oxides and clay minerals (R²adj = 0.625). Enrichment factors showed elevated values for Pb, Zn, and Cu (median EF = 4.6–10.2) relative to Cr and Ni (median EF ~ 1), though interpretation is complicated by matrix heterogeneity and methodological limitations. These findings demonstrate that WUI fire ash poses significant contamination risks requiring targeted remediation, and that mineralogical context is essential for understanding metal distribution and potential mobility.

## 1. Introduction

Wildland-urban interface (WUI) fires have increased dramatically in frequency and intensity across the western United States, driven by climate change, fuel accumulation, and expanding development into fire-prone landscapes (Radeloff et al., 2018; Schoennagel et al., 2017). Unlike fires in undeveloped wildlands, WUI fires combust a heterogeneous mixture of natural vegetation and anthropogenic materials including building structures, vehicles, household items, and industrial products (Alexakis, 2020; Bodí et al., 2014). This combustion generates ash with complex geochemical signatures that may pose significant risks to human health and environmental quality.

The composition of wildfire ash reflects both the materials burned and the combustion conditions experienced. Natural vegetation ash is typically dominated by calcium, potassium, and carbonite minerals, with trace metals primarily derived from soil entrainment and plant bioaccumulation (Pereira et al., 2012; Ulery et al., 1993). In contrast, WUI ash can contain elevated concentrations of lead (from paints, batteries, and plumbing), zinc (galvanized metals, rubber), copper (wiring, pipes), arsenic (treated wood, pesticides), and chromium (treated lumber, pigments) at levels exceeding regulatory thresholds (Gabbert et al., 2014; Plumlee et al., 2007).

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) establishes Regional Screening Levels (RSLs) for soil contaminants based on residential exposure scenarios, providing risk-based benchmarks for assessing contamination (EPA, 2023). For WUI fire ash, exceedance of these thresholds indicates potential human health risks from dermal contact, ingestion, and inhalation of wind-mobilized particulates during the post-fire period. Previous studies of WUI fires have documented substantial RSL exceedances for multiple metals (Plumlee et al., 2007; Wolf et al., 2015), though rapid assessment methods remain limited.

Remote sensing offers potential for rapid, spatially comprehensive characterization of fire-affected areas. Airborne imaging spectroscopy systems such as AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) can detect spectral signatures associated with ash mineralogy and charred materials at meter-scale resolution (Kokaly et al., 2017; Dennison et al., 2019). Field-portable reflectance spectrometers enable point-scale measurements that can be linked to laboratory geochemistry (Clark et al., 1990). Integration of these approaches with traditional geochemical analysis could enable more efficient contamination assessment across large fire footprints.

The January 2025 Eaton Fire burned over 14,000 acres in Los Angeles County, California, destroying thousands of structures in densely developed WUI communities including Altadena and Pasadena. The fire provided an opportunity to assess the utility of multi-modal analytical approaches for characterizing WUI ash contamination. In this study, we address three primary science questions:

1. **PSQ-1:** What are the concentrations and spatial patterns of metal contamination in Eaton Fire ash, and to what extent do they exceed EPA screening thresholds?

2. **PSQ-2:** Can field spectroscopy and airborne imaging predict metal concentrations, enabling rapid contamination screening?

3. **PSQ-3:** What mineral phases host the metals of concern, and how does mineralogical context inform mobility and remediation strategies?

## 2. Materials and Methods

### 2.1 Study Area

The Eaton Fire ignited on January 7, 2025, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains northeast of Los Angeles, California. Driven by Santa Ana winds exceeding 100 km/hr, the fire rapidly spread through residential communities in Altadena and adjacent unincorporated areas. The burn perimeter encompassed approximately 14,117 acres (5,714 ha), with over 9,400 structures damaged or destroyed. The study area spans elevations from approximately 300 to 600 m, with vegetation dominated by chaparral and coastal sage scrub communities intermixed with ornamental landscaping in developed areas.

[**END PLACEHOLDER - approximately 0.5 pages**]

#### 2.3.2 ICP-MS Analysis

Trace element concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) following acid digestion. Samples were digested using EPA Method 3051A (microwave-assisted HNO₃/HCl digestion) and analyzed for 60+ elements including priority contaminants Pb, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn. Calibration was performed using certified multi-element standards with matrix-matched quality control samples analyzed every 10 samples. Detection limits ranged from 0.01 to 1 ppm depending on the element.

#### 2.3.3 XRF Analysis and Calibration Validation

Major element compositions were determined by energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) on pressed powder pellets. Analysis provided weight percent concentrations for SiO₂, Al₂O₃, Fe₂O₃, CaO, MgO, Na₂O, K₂O, TiO₂, P₂O₅, MnO, and SO₃. Certified reference materials were analyzed to verify accuracy, with precision typically <5% relative standard deviation for major elements.

Matrix effects in XRF analysis of heterogeneous ash samples were addressed through fundamental parameters corrections and Compton normalization (Markowicz, 2008; Rowe et al., 2012). The intensity of the Compton peak changes with matrix composition, allowing normalization to reduce inter-sample variability. Cross-validation between XRF and ICP-MS measurements was performed for Pb, Zn, and Cu to assess analytical consistency and identify potential matrix-induced biases. Previous comparisons of portable XRF and ICP-MS have demonstrated strong correlations for Pb (R² typically >0.89) with systematic underestimation of Pb and overestimation of As by XRF in soil matrices (Weindorf et al., 2014; Parsons et al., 2024).

#### 2.3.4 Field Spectroscopy (ASD)

Field reflectance spectra were collected using an ASD FieldSpec spectroradiometer covering the 350–2500 nm wavelength range. Measurements were acquired under natural illumination with a contact probe to minimize atmospheric effects. Each sample location was measured in triplicate and averaged. Spectra were processed to extract 18 diagnostic features including continuum-removed absorption depths at 480, 530, 670, 870, 1400, 1900, 2200, and 2300 nm, regional slopes (visible, NIR, SWIR), albedo metrics, and mineralogical indices for iron oxides, carbonates, and char.

#### 2.3.5 ATR-FTIR Spectroscopy

Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectra were collected on bulk ash samples using a Thermo Nicolet spectrometer with diamond ATR accessory. Spectra were acquired from 4000 to 400 cm⁻¹ at 4 cm⁻¹ resolution with 64 co-added scans. Mineral phases were identified by comparison with reference libraries and diagnostic absorption features for carbonates (1420, 875 cm⁻¹), silicates (1080, 798 cm⁻¹), sulfates (1140, 600 cm⁻¹), and iron oxides (540, 460 cm⁻¹).

#### 2.3.6 AVIRIS-3 Airborne Imaging

AVIRIS-3 imaging spectroscopy data were acquired on January 11 and 16, 2025, during NASA emergency response flights. The sensor provides 380 spectral channels from 380 to 2510 nm at approximately 5 nm spectral resolution and 3–5 m spatial resolution. Pre-computed products including charred ash fraction maps, differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), and principal component images were provided by the AVIRIS team. Raster values were extracted at sample locations using bilinear interpolation.

### 2.4 Data Analysis

#### 2.4.1 Data Harmonization

Sample identifiers were harmonized across analytical datasets using a crosswalk table linking field IDs to laboratory designations. A master dataset was constructed containing 94 variables for 42 samples, with data tier classifications based on analytical completeness: Tier 1 (ICP-MS + XRF + ASD + FTIR, n=20), Tier 2 (ICP-MS + XRF, n=16), and Tier 3 (ICP-MS only, n=6).

#### 2.4.2 EPA Screening Level Assessment

Metal concentrations were compared to EPA Regional Screening Levels (RSLs) for residential soil using the May 2023 screening table. Exceedance rates were calculated as the percentage of samples exceeding each threshold. Metals assessed included Pb (RSL = 400 ppm), As (0.68 ppm, cancer-based), Cd (70 ppm), Cr (5.6 ppm as Cr VI), Cu (3100 ppm), Ni (1500 ppm), Zn (23,000 ppm), Mn (1800 ppm), and Ba (15,000 ppm).

#### 2.4.3 Spatial Analysis

Spatial patterns were assessed using global and local measures of spatial autocorrelation. Moran's I statistics were calculated using k-nearest neighbor spatial weights (k=5) on log-transformed metal concentrations. Local clustering was evaluated using Getis-Ord Gi* statistics to identify statistically significant hotspots (z > 1.96) and coldspots (z < -1.96) at α = 0.05. Analyses were performed in R using the spdep package.

#### 2.4.4 Spectral Prediction Modeling

Partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were developed to predict metal concentrations from ASD spectral features. Models were calibrated using leave-one-out cross-validation with optimal component selection based on minimum root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). Variable importance was assessed using loading weights, with the top three features identified for each metal. Random forest regression provided comparative non-linear modeling with out-of-bag error estimation.

#### 2.4.5 Mineral-Metal Association Analysis

Mineral phase proxies were calculated from XRF compositions: carbonate proxy (CaO/SiO₂), Fe-oxide proxy (Fe₂O₃), silicate proxy (SiO₂/Al₂O₃), clay proxy (Al₂O₃/SiO₂), sulfate proxy (SO₃), and phosphate proxy (P₂O₅). Pearson correlations and partial correlations (controlling for Fe) were calculated between mineral proxies and metal concentrations. Multiple linear regression models were fit with metals as response variables and mineral proxies as predictors.

#### 2.4.6 Enrichment Factors and Elemental Ratios

**Enrichment factors (EF)** were calculated using aluminum as the normalizing element (Sutherland, 2000; Reimann & de Caritat, 2005):

EF = (X/Al)_sample / (X/Al)_reference

where X is the metal concentration. Upper Continental Crust (UCC) values from Taylor and McLennan (1995) served as the geochemical reference (Pb = 17 ppm, Zn = 67 ppm, Cu = 28 ppm, Cr = 92 ppm, Ni = 47 ppm, Al = 81,500 ppm). The conventional EF = 2 threshold is often used to indicate concentrations above crustal background (Sutherland, 2000), though this boundary is arbitrary and EF values should be interpreted as continuous variables rather than discrete categories.

**Elemental ratios** (Pb/Zn, Cu/Zn, Pb/Cu, Ca/Mg) were calculated to characterize compositional variability among samples. These ratios have been used in contamination studies to characterize metal associations (Chen et al., 2010; Meza-Figueroa et al., 2007), though their interpretive value in complex mixed matrices like WUI ash is limited.

Correlations between metals and XRF-derived mineral proxies (sulfate, silicate, carbonate indices) were examined to characterize metal-mineral associations. Inter-metal correlations were calculated to identify co-occurrence patterns.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Metal Concentrations and EPA Exceedances

Metal concentrations in Eaton Fire ash spanned several orders of magnitude, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of combusted materials (Table 1). Lead concentrations ranged from 38 to 804 ppm (median = 56 ppm), with the highest values occurring in samples collected from destroyed residential structures. Zinc showed the greatest variability (144–3685 ppm, median = 223 ppm), followed by copper (37–857 ppm, median = 60 ppm). Arsenic concentrations were consistently elevated (4.0–12.2 ppm, median = 6.3 ppm), as were chromium values (30–138 ppm, median = 43 ppm).

Comparison to EPA RSLs revealed universal exceedance for arsenic and chromium (Table 2). All 39 ash samples exceeded the arsenic RSL of 0.68 ppm, with concentrations averaging 18× the screening threshold. Similarly, 100% of samples exceeded the chromium RSL of 5.6 ppm (based on carcinogenic Cr VI assumptions), with a mean exceedance factor of 8×. Lead exceeded the 400 ppm RSL in 15.4% of samples (n=6), with maximum concentrations reaching 2× the threshold. No samples exceeded RSLs for cadmium, copper, nickel, zinc, manganese, or barium.

The number of simultaneous RSL exceedances per sample ranged from 2 to 3, with all samples exceeding at least the As and Cr thresholds. Samples with Pb exceedance also exceeded Mn thresholds, indicating co-occurrence of these metals in the most contaminated samples.

### 3.2 XRF-ICP-MS Cross-Validation and Matrix Effects

Cross-validation between XRF and ICP-MS measurements (n = 37) revealed strong correlations for trace metals (Pb: r = 0.990; Zn: r = 0.996; Cu: r = 0.920), consistent with previous XRF-ICP-MS comparisons in soil matrices (Parsons et al., 2024). However, systematic offsets were observed, with XRF consistently reporting higher values than acid-extractable ICP-MS concentrations (median log₁₀(ICP-MS/XRF): Pb = -0.74, Zn = -0.59, Cu = -0.66).

The XRF-ICP-MS discrepancy correlated with matrix composition (Figure 7B). Samples with higher organic/volatile content showed reduced discrepancy (Pb: r = 0.58; Zn: r = 0.35), while samples with higher Fe-oxide content showed larger offsets (Pb: r = -0.55; Zn: r = -0.53). This pattern is consistent with matrix absorption effects in XRF analysis, where high-Z matrix elements (Fe) enhance secondary fluorescence while organic-rich matrices attenuate X-ray intensities. Similar correlations with silicate content (r = 0.58 for Pb) reflect the lower mass absorption coefficients of Si-Al matrices.

These findings indicate that the XRF-ICP-MS offset varies predictably with ash matrix composition, with implications for field-deployable pXRF screening. Correction factors based on major element composition could improve agreement between techniques.

### 3.3 Enrichment Factors and Elemental Ratios

#### 3.3.1 Enrichment Factor Distributions

Aluminum-normalized enrichment factors showed contrasting patterns among metals (Table 5, Figure S2A). Median enrichment factors were: Pb = 6.9, Zn = 10.2, Cu = 4.6, Cr = 0.9, and Ni = 1.1. Using the conventional EF > 2 threshold, 100% of samples exceeded this value for Pb and Zn, 97% for Cu, but only 23% for Cr and 31% for Ni.

The EF distributions showed substantial variability, particularly for Pb (range: 2.8–2559) and Zn (range: 2.6–1545). Several samples exhibited very high EF values (>100) that likely reflect localized heterogeneity, matrix effects from low Al concentrations, or sample-specific compositional differences. The interquartile ranges (Pb: 5.1–21.1, Zn: 4.8–48.4, Cu: 3.0–17.4) provide more robust central tendency estimates than means, which are strongly influenced by these extreme values. The high coefficients of variation (>150% for all metals) reflect the inherent heterogeneity of WUI ash rather than analytical uncertainty.

#### 3.3.2 Elemental Ratios

Elemental ratios showed wide ranges reflecting compositional heterogeneity (Table 6, Figure S2B):

- **Pb/Zn ratios** ranged from 0.003 to 9.3 (median = 0.254, IQR = 0.12–0.36). Most samples (85%) fell within 0.1–0.5.
- **Cu/Zn ratios** ranged from 0.004 to 1.9 (median = 0.211).
- **Pb/Cu ratios** showed high variability (range: 0.06–136, median = 1.2).

The predominance of intermediate ratio values indicates that most ash samples represent heterogeneous mixtures. Samples with extreme ratios represent compositional end-members within the dataset.

#### 3.3.3 Multi-Spectral Mineral Proxy Associations

Correlations between metals and mineral proxies derived from multiple spectral sources (XRF, ASD, AVIRIS) revealed consistent association patterns (Figure 7C):

**XRF-derived proxies:**
- Zn showed positive correlations with sulfate proxy (r = 0.60) and silicate proxy (r = 0.72).
- Cr correlated positively with carbonate proxy (r = 0.68).
- Pb showed weak correlations with most mineral proxies (|r| < 0.4), with slight negative associations with clay (r = -0.35) and FeOx (r = -0.37).
- Cd and Ni correlated with sulfate proxy (r = 0.66 and 0.50, respectively).

**ASD-derived proxies:**
- The ASD char index showed minimal correlation with metal concentrations (|r| < 0.2 for Pb, Zn, Cu; Figure 7D), indicating that field spectroscopy-derived organic proxies do not directly predict metal abundance.
- AVIRIS charash fraction similarly showed weak metal correlations (|r| < 0.3).

**Interpretation:** These differential associations indicate that metals are distributed among different mineral phases within the ash matrix. The consistency between XRF-derived and spectroscopy-derived proxies supports the robustness of the mineral association patterns, while the weak char-metal correlations indicate that organic/char content is not a primary control on metal concentration.

#### 3.3.4 Inter-Metal Relationships

Metal correlation analysis showed:

- Strong Pb-Cu correlation (r = 0.96), indicating co-occurrence of these metals.
- Moderate Cr-Ni correlation (r = 0.43).
- Weak Pb-Zn correlation (r = 0.05), indicating independent distributions.
- Weak to negative correlations between Pb/Zn/Cu and Fe (r = -0.29 to +0.09).

The weak Pb-Zn correlation despite both metals showing elevated EF values indicates these metals are not directly associated in the ash matrix.

### 3.4 Spatial Distribution and Clustering

Spatial analysis revealed significant non-random patterns for several metals (Figure 3). Global Moran's I statistics indicated positive spatial autocorrelation for zinc (I = 0.667, p < 0.001), lead (I = 0.454, p < 0.001), copper (I = 0.378, p = 0.003), and iron (I = 0.312, p = 0.009). Calcium and arsenic showed no significant spatial structure (p > 0.05), suggesting more uniform distribution across the study area.

Local hotspot analysis using Getis-Ord Gi* identified seven statistically significant Pb hotspots (z > 1.96) concentrated in the western portion of the burn perimeter (Figure 3D). Five Pb coldspots were identified in peripheral areas. The Zn hotspot pattern largely overlapped with Pb spatially.

### 3.5 Spectral Prediction of Metal Concentrations

PLSR models demonstrated variable success in predicting metal concentrations from ASD spectral features (Table 4). Calcium showed the strongest predictive relationship (R²cv = 0.365, RMSECV = 0.266 log units), with important features including water absorption depth at 1900 nm, NIR slope, and the 530 nm iron absorption feature. This moderate predictability reflects the strong spectral signature of carbonate minerals in the visible and SWIR regions.

Toxic metals showed weaker spectral relationships. Zinc models achieved R²cv = 0.131, lead R²cv = 0.064, and copper models explained no cross-validated variance (R²cv < 0). The limited predictability for toxic metals reflects both the small sample size (n = 21 paired observations) and the fact that trace metal concentrations are not directly expressed in reflectance spectra at typical ash concentrations.

Random forest models showed similar performance patterns, with Ca achieving the highest out-of-bag R² (0.238) and toxic metals showing minimal predictability. Spectral features most frequently appearing in top-ranked importance across metals included the 1900 nm water absorption depth, 530 nm and 670 nm iron-related features, and NIR slope.

### 3.6 Mineral-Metal Associations

Correlation analysis revealed distinct mineral phase affinities for different metals (Figure 4, Table 5). Zinc showed the strongest association with the silicate proxy (r = 0.833, p < 0.001), suggesting incorporation into or adsorption onto alumino-silicate phases. Chromium correlated strongly with the carbonate proxy (r = 0.693, p < 0.001), potentially reflecting co-precipitation with calcite or substitution for Ca in carbonate structures. Cadmium and nickel both showed strong positive correlations with the sulfate proxy (r = 0.679 and 0.649, respectively), consistent with sulfate mineral hosts or surface complexation.

Lead showed more complex associations, with negative correlations with Fe-oxide and clay proxies but positive correlation with the silicate ratio. Partial correlation analysis controlling for Fe content revealed that the Pb-sulfate relationship became negative after accounting for matrix effects, suggesting that Pb distribution is influenced by multiple competing mineral hosts.

Multiple regression models incorporating all mineral proxies explained substantial variance for most metals (Table 3). Zinc was best predicted (R²adj = 0.838, p < 0.0001), followed by chromium (R²adj = 0.782), nickel (R²adj = 0.688), lead (R²adj = 0.625), and cadmium (R²adj = 0.554). Copper and arsenic showed weaker mineral associations (R²adj = 0.195 and 0.054, respectively), suggesting their distribution is controlled by factors not captured by bulk mineralogical proxies.

### 3.7 AVIRIS Integration

AVIRIS-derived charred ash fraction values ranged from 0 to 0.90 at sample locations, with 69% spatial coverage across the sampling network. Correlations between charash fraction and metal concentrations were generally weak (|r| < 0.3 for most metals), though the relationship may be confounded by the 3–5 m pixel resolution relative to point sample locations. The dNBR burn severity index showed moderate positive correlation with total metal load (r = 0.31), consistent with higher-severity combustion mobilizing more metals from burned materials.

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Contamination Assessment and Human Health Implications

The universal exceedance of EPA RSLs for arsenic and chromium across all Eaton Fire ash samples underscores the contamination risks posed by WUI fire residues. While arsenic exceedance reflects the very conservative cancer-based screening level (0.68 ppm), the concentrations observed (median 6.3 ppm) nonetheless represent meaningful exposure hazards during the post-fire period. The 100% chromium exceedance is particularly concerning given that the RSL assumes hexavalent chromium, the more toxic and carcinogenic form, which may comprise a variable fraction of total Cr in ash matrices.

Lead exceedance in 15.4% of samples was spatially clustered (Moran's I = 0.454), with hotspots concentrated in the western portion of the study area. The spatial clustering of Pb contamination provides actionable information for prioritizing remediation efforts. Areas identified as statistically significant hotspots warrant enhanced characterization and potentially more aggressive cleanup standards.

These findings align with previous WUI fire studies documenting metal contamination in ash. Plumlee et al. (2007) reported similar exceedance patterns following Southern California fires, while Wolf et al. (2015) documented Pb hotspots associated with destroyed structures in Colorado. The consistency of these patterns across fires and regions supports the development of standardized WUI ash assessment protocols.

### 4.2 Spectral Prediction Capabilities and Limitations

The limited success of spectral prediction models for toxic metals constrains the potential for remote sensing-based contamination screening. While calcium showed moderate predictability (R²cv = 0.365)—useful for mapping ash mineralogy—the toxic metals of primary regulatory concern (Pb, As, Cu) could not be reliably predicted from reflectance spectra.

This result is not unexpected. Metal concentrations in the tens to hundreds of ppm range are typically below detection limits for reflectance spectroscopy, which requires percent-level abundances for direct detection (Clark, 1999). Any spectral relationships observed likely reflect indirect associations with spectrally active mineral phases that serve as metal hosts. The strong performance for Ca reflects the high carbonate content of ash and the distinct spectral signature of calcite.

The small paired sample size (n = 21) further limited model development. Future studies should prioritize co-located spectral and geochemical measurements to enable more robust multivariate modeling. Additionally, thermal infrared spectroscopy, which is more sensitive to mineral phases, may offer improved prediction of mineralogically-hosted metals.

### 4.3 Enrichment Factor Interpretation and Limitations

The enrichment factor data reveal contrasting patterns among metals that warrant careful interpretation given the methodological limitations of EF calculations in heterogeneous matrices.

**Observed patterns.** Median EF values differed substantially among metals: Pb (6.9), Zn (10.2), and Cu (4.6) showed values above the conventional EF = 2 threshold in most or all samples, while Cr (0.9) and Ni (1.1) showed median values near unity. This contrast indicates different concentration patterns relative to the UCC reference, though the interpretation of these differences requires consideration of several factors.

**Methodological limitations.** The EF approach has well-documented limitations that affect interpretation: (1) UCC reference values represent global average continental crust and may not accurately reflect local soil or bedrock composition; (2) Al normalization assumes Al derives entirely from natural sources, which may not hold for ash containing Al-bearing construction materials (e.g., aluminum siding, window frames); (3) very low Al concentrations in some samples produce artificially inflated EF values, as evidenced by the extreme outliers (EF > 100) that strongly influence mean values; and (4) the EF = 2 threshold, while conventionally used, represents an arbitrary boundary rather than a geochemically meaningful distinction.

**Variability considerations.** The high coefficients of variation (>150% for all metals) indicate substantial sample-to-sample heterogeneity. This variability likely reflects real compositional differences among samples collected from different microenvironments within the burn area, rather than analytical uncertainty. The interquartile ranges provide more robust characterization of central tendency than means for these right-skewed distributions.

**Elemental ratios.** The wide ranges observed for Pb/Zn (0.003–9.3), Cu/Zn (0.004–1.9), and Pb/Cu (0.06–136) ratios reflect the compositional heterogeneity of WUI ash. While literature studies have associated specific ratio ranges with particular material types, the mixed nature of WUI combustion products and the lack of local reference materials preclude definitive source attribution based on ratios alone.

**Mineral associations.** The differential correlations between metals and mineral proxies (e.g., Zn-silicate r = 0.83, Cr-carbonate r = 0.69) indicate that metals are partitioned among different phases within the ash matrix. These associations provide information on metal speciation but do not directly indicate ultimate sources.

**Spatial patterns.** The significant spatial clustering observed for Pb and Zn (Moran's I = 0.45–0.67) contrasts with the random distribution of As and Ca, indicating spatially heterogeneous metal distributions. The co-location of Pb and Zn hotspots suggests these metals share similar spatial controls, though the nature of these controls cannot be determined from the geochemical data alone.

In summary, the EF and ratio data document substantial enrichment of Pb, Zn, and Cu relative to crustal reference values and reveal heterogeneous metal distributions within the study area. However, definitive source attribution is not possible given the mixed nature of WUI combustion products and the limitations of the enrichment factor methodology.

### 4.4 Mineralogical Controls on Metal Distribution

The strong mineral-metal associations observed provide mechanistic insight into metal distribution and have implications for understanding metal mobility and bioavailability. The silicate association for Zn (R²adj = 0.838) suggests incorporation into glass phases or alumino-silicate structures formed during high-temperature combustion, potentially limiting immediate bioavailability. Conversely, the sulfate associations for Cd and Ni indicate more soluble phases that could release metals upon wetting.

The carbonate-chromium association (r = 0.693) is noteworthy given the potential for Cr incorporation into calcite structures or adsorption onto carbite surfaces. If Cr is hosted in carbonates, it may be released under acidic conditions but remain relatively immobile at neutral to alkaline pH typical of fresh ash.

Lead distribution appears controlled by multiple mineral phases, with Fe-oxides and clays serving as important hosts. Iron oxyhydroxides are well-established sorbents for Pb in environmental systems (Kosmulski, 2009), and their presence in fire ash reflects oxidation of Fe-bearing organic matter and soil minerals during combustion. The implications for Pb mobility depend on the crystallinity and surface area of these phases, which warrant further characterization.

### 4.5 Recommendations for Rapid Assessment

Based on our findings, we recommend a tiered approach for WUI ash assessment:

**Tier 1 - Remote Sensing Screening:** AVIRIS or similar imaging spectroscopy can map charred material extent and burn severity, identifying areas of structural destruction that warrant ground-based sampling. While spectral data cannot directly predict metal concentrations, the spatial coverage enables efficient prioritization.

**Tier 2 - Field Spectroscopy and pXRF:** Portable XRF provides field-deployable metal screening that can identify hotspots in near-real-time. Field reflectance spectroscopy adds mineralogical context that informs mobility predictions. Together, these methods enable rapid spatial characterization without laboratory turnaround delays.

**Tier 3 - Laboratory Confirmation:** ICP-MS and detailed mineralogical analysis (XRD, SEM-EDS) remain essential for regulatory compliance and mechanistic understanding. Laboratory analysis should focus on hotspot areas identified in earlier tiers and representative samples across the contamination gradient.

### 4.6 Limitations

Several limitations constrain interpretation of these results. The sample size (n = 39), while adequate for descriptive statistics and spatial analysis, limited the power of predictive modeling, particularly for spectral relationships. The cross-sectional sampling design captured spatial variability but not temporal changes in ash composition during weathering. AVIRIS coverage was incomplete (69% of sample locations), and the multi-day acquisition window introduced potential variability in illumination and atmospheric conditions.

The use of bulk XRF-derived mineral proxies rather than direct mineralogical analysis (XRD) introduces uncertainty in phase assignments. The carbonate proxy (CaO/SiO₂), for example, does not distinguish calcite from Ca in glass or silicate phases. Future work should incorporate quantitative mineralogy to refine metal-host relationships.

## 5. Conclusions

Multi-modal geochemical and spectroscopic analysis of Eaton Fire ash reveals significant metal contamination posing potential human health risks. Key findings include:

1. **Universal arsenic and chromium exceedance** of EPA screening levels demonstrates that WUI fire ash should be treated as contaminated material requiring appropriate handling and disposal.

2. **Spatial clustering of lead contamination** enables targeted remediation prioritization, with hotspots concentrated in areas of older residential construction.

3. **Strong mineral-phase controls** on metal distribution (Zn-silicates, Cr-carbonates, Cd/Ni-sulfates, Pb-Fe oxides) inform predictions of metal mobility and bioavailability that are relevant to remediation strategy selection.

4. **Limited spectral predictability** for toxic metals constrains remote sensing applications to mapping ash extent and burn severity rather than direct contamination assessment.

5. **Integrated analytical approaches** combining field-deployable methods (pXRF, ASD) with laboratory confirmation (ICP-MS, XRF) provide the most efficient pathway to comprehensive contamination characterization.

As WUI fires increase in frequency and intensity, standardized protocols for rapid ash assessment become increasingly critical. The multi-modal framework demonstrated here provides a template for future fire response efforts integrating remote sensing, field spectroscopy, and laboratory geochemistry.
